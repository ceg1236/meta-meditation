meta-meditation
===============

Join a meditative community by seeing all currently active (or passive, as the case may be) users at any given time. A simple button press and a timer selection sets your session - whether it is a seated meditation or a moving meditation like Yoga or Tai Chi. Your position will be indicated to all others viewing the Tsonga Map. 
The map shows nearby meditators who you may join, either in-person or by meditating wherever you may be. 

While meditation is often private and quiet, practices of public and group meditation foster great levels of mindfulness and peace. As traditions through the ages have expounded, a meditative community encourages members to continue with their practices, strengthening connectedness with each other and the World.

This technology serves as a tool to bring people together. 
Contributions and ideas are welcome.
